Total non-esterified fatty acids, but not individual fatty acids, predict progression in beta-cell dysfunction: The Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort

Many thanks for submitting this manuscript to Diabetologia. Firstly, my apologies for the length of time it has taken us to reach a decision. It has now been reviewed by two experts in the field and by one of our Associate Editors, and their comments are given below. As you will see, our referees have identified a number of important issues which currently mean that your work is not competitive.

In light of these concerns I am unable to consider this paper for publication in Diabetologia. At the same time I note that your message is potentially of interest to our readers. If you believe that the issues raised by the referees can be effectively countered I would be prepared to consider a new manuscript, but this would have to re-enter the peer-review process as a new submission, and I must stress that there can be no guarantee whatsoever concerning eventual acceptance. Perhaps it will be helpful if I explain that this decision is not a straightforward request to revise your manuscript in line with the referees’ comments. It is a rejection of the present paper but allowing you the opportunity to submit a reworked paper which would not benefit from any advantages or guarantees in terms of peer review. Indeed, the rejection rate for resubmitted papers is high and we would not consider any subsequent appeals against a negative decision. I am sorry if this sounds very harsh, but we would prefer authors to be aware of the challenges ahead to avoid potential disappointment.

If you decide to resubmit you should do so within 12 months of this decision letter. Please highlight in colour all changes and new material in your paper; do not show deletions or use the ‘track changes’ function of Word. Please also include a response to the referees' comments in a covering letter; this could be a point-by-point list or you may find that a more general summary is appropriate if the paper has been rewritten. Please be aware that we might ask new referees to review your resubmitted manuscript if the Associate Editor feels that another opinion is warranted – these referees would see the previous referees’ comments and your response but would be asked to treat your article as a completely new, standalone paper.

I have attached instructions giving details of how to resubmit your manuscript, should you wish to do so. If you have any queries please don’t hesitate to contact the Editorial Office (diabetologia-j@bristol.ac.uk).

Yours sincerely

Comments to the Author
First, I would like to congratulate you for the exhaustive and complete research work that has been done for this paper. I think the statistical study is very successful and useful for researchers who have accumulated a large database and need a method with the ability to handle a large number of variables and their interactions.
I really liked read in the discussion the negative points of the study, with which I fully agree, and not an attempt to hide the limitations of any scientific work. In retrospect, perhaps it will miss data that clarify the pre-diabetic state, or not, of the patients (HbA1c or C-peptide). I think it would be good for the study know if some patients were taking any medication that could affect the results.
Although it is a complicated scientific work to understand for researchers who do not usually use this kind of statistical studies, I believe that is described in a very appropriate and clear manner.

Comments to the Author
The present paper addresses an important and yet unresolved research question regarding the role of non-esterified fatty acids on the trajectories of metabolic traits of diabetes (insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function). The analysis is based on a cohort study with repeated measures (up to 3 times per individual) over 6 years of follow-up using generalized estimating equations (GEE). This is a well-established method to analyse longitudinal data. The authors in general did a thorough analysis however some major questions related to methods and interpretation remains.
After the trajectory analysis they run partial least-squares discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) with groups defined by beta-cell trajectories (latent class analysis) and defined by glycemic status as outcomes. While the primary analysis is well-described and easy to follow, these additional analyses are described mostly in the online appendix and much harder to interpret for the general reader. In my opinion, these do not add substantial information to the paper and the conclusion, and I would move these to the online appendix or drop them from the paper.
I think that the paper needs a major revision however both the dataset and the study questions are adequate and important thus conditional acceptance is reasonable.

Major and minor points

1. Title of the paper: it is a statement of the results. I would prefer to leave it open ended without an interpretation of the results, as with different levels of adjustments the results and conclusion will change substantially. See also comments on the results section.
2. Methods in the abstract:
a. Please give some information on the cohort characteristics:
i. age, sex
ii. high risk of diabetes but no prevalent disease at baseline
b. incident diabetes cases (how were these handled? what about treated patients? – these should go in the main methods section)
c. adjustment for time – I would prefer to state that time since baseline was used as the underlying time variable instead of adjusting for time
3. Results in the abstract:
a. a major problem in my view with the interpretation of the results is that all characteristics are taken as confounders although a considerable proportion of time-varying covariates are taken after the NEFA measurements. Furthermore, it is not clear whether these measures are confounders, mediators or NEFAs are mediators of these variables. I think that unadjusted results are as interesting and require discussion as the fully adjusted and selected models. Regarding the abstract, I would show both the unadjusted and the fully adjusted results here.
4. Conclusions in abstract: I have a different interpretation of the results, particularly because adjustment waist may be an over-adjustment.
5. INTRODUCTION
a. a clear and well-written introduction with a clear objective and hypothesis
6. MATERIALS & METHODS:
a. ESM Figure 1 is not clear to me.
i. Prevalent diabetes cases were excluded at baseline (n=XX)
ii. the lines suggest that everyone had to have a year 6 visit, ehile in the main text, the authors state that any follow-up visit was enough for being included (this corresponds well with the GEE requirements).
iii. what happened with incident diabetes cases? Were treated diabetes cases included in the analysis? How does that effect measures of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function? I suggest to exclude those visits where diabetes was treated.
b. I would prefer to see the equations for the outcome measures. Why not use HOMA2-IS instead of 1/HOMA-IR?
c. In the statistical analysis you state that co-variates were time-dependent. This is not true for age at baseline, family history, sex, ethnicity. Please clarify in the text.
d. misspelling: “statistically significance”
e. I am not an expert of PLS-DA but it is not clear to me, why does this analysis reflect more the role of relative NEFA (mole%) analysis than the concentration analysis? As I can see, it depends on what variables you feed in the model.
7. RESULTS:
a. Please give ns in Table 1.
b. It would be also nice to see, how many participants had 1, 2 or 3 time points in the analysis.
c. How were the changes calculated (GEE?) in the basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort section?
d. I suggest to include the unadjusted data to the main paper (ESM Figure 3) and describe these findings as we do not know the exact model where over-adjustment start to happen.
e. In a trajectory analysis, the interaction between time and the main predictor (NEFA in this case) is of major interest. The authors check for this interaction only as the last step of their model building (see ESM). I would suggest to perform this as the first step of the analysis (M0), and drop this term, if it is non-significant or does not improve model fit. Furthermore, given that this interaction was dropped from the model, it is hard to except the major conclusion that NEFA predicts progression of beat-cell dysfunction. Actually what is found here is that NEFA are related to beta-cell function in repeated cross-sectional analyses and NEFA related differences in beta-cell function remain constant over time.
f. The model building is based on literature data which is the right way to build the models but a more detailed discussion on over-adjustment is required before interpretation.
g. Latent classes. Although this is a very attractive method, based on ESM figure 4, there are 3 parallel declining group trajectories that is mostly affected by the baseline values. Groups based on baseline (last follow-up) tertiles would be easier to interpret.
h. The PLS-DA analysis needs further description. I would expect variables with the highest loadings to be the variables in the unadjusted GEE analysis. I am probably wrong given the results.
i. Do we really expect good discrimination? The associations are week to nul between NEFAs and the outcomes. I do not really see the point the extensive supplementary analysis on PLS-DA. Furthermore dysglycemia is an outcome that is not directly related to beta-cell function only. Dysglycemia requires both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.
j. The authors mention in the Discussion the external validity is mostly limited to white females. I suggest to run a sensitivity analysis on this group.
8. DISCUSSION
a. I would like to see more on the DAGs that underlies the selected variables in the models. That would either confirm the way the analysis is currently performed, or would show that some of the adjustments are over-adjustment.
b. In the time-varying analysis some covariates are measured after NEFAs, thus adjustment for them could be over-adjustment just because they are measured closer to the outcome of interest.

Comments to the Author:
Many thanks for submitting this potentially interesting paper. The second reviewer comes with some very helpful comments that will need to be addressed in detail. There is need to consider the results from the Paris Prospective study: Charles MA et al.
