Diabetologia  

Dear Dr. Marshall,

Attached please find our manuscript entitled, "Total non-esterified fatty acids, but not individual fatty acids, predict progression in beta-cell dysfunction:  The Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort‚Äù, which we would like to have considered for publication in Diabetologia. The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere. Much of the literature on NEFA and it's role in diabetes has been published in Diabetologia and as such we believe our study and findings would be of interest to your readers and would be an ideal venue for publication.

To date, no studies have examined the longitudinal role of NEFA composition on the underlying disorders of diabetes. The  present manuscript is the first to report on these associations with the NEFA composition in a longitudinal cohort. Briefly, we found that the absolute size of the total serum NEFA fraction, and not the specific composition, was associated with beta-cell dysfunction. This novel finding contributes substantially to this evolving area of research and reinforces the known harmful effect of higher total NEFA on the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Thank you for considering our manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
