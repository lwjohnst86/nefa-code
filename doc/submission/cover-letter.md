William T. Cefalu, MD 
Editor-in-Chief 
Diabetes Care

Dear Dr. Cefalu,

Attached please find our manuscript entitled, "Total non-esterified fatty acids, but not individual fatty acids, predict progression in beta-cell dysfunction:  The Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort‚Äù, which we would like to have considered for publication in Diabetes Care. The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere. We hope you find it of interest to your readers and suitable for publication.

To date, no studies have examined the longitudinal role of the non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) composition on the underlying disorders of diabetes. The  present manuscript is the first to report on these associations with the NEFA composition in a longitudinal cohort. Briefly, we found that the absolute size of the total serum NEFA fraction, and not the specific composition, was associated with beta-cell dysfunction. This novel finding contributes  substantially to this evolving area of research and reinforces the known harmful effect of higher total NEFA on the pathogenesis of diabetes.

We would like to include supplemental material along with the manuscript. In our analysis we used multiple statistical techniques to confirm our findings. A few of the techniques and results may not be familiar to some of the Diabetes Care readership and may need additional explanation, which is included as a supplemental methods.

Thank you for considering our manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
