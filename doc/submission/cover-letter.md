Professor Sally Marshall  
Editor-in-Chief  
Diabetologia  

Dear Dr. Marshall,

Attached please find the resubmission of our manuscript entitled, "Association of non-esterified fatty acid composition with insulin sensitivity and beta-cell dysfunction in the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort", which we have revised in response to comments from the reviewers and editors. The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere.

We feel our revised manuscript has been strengthened from incorporation of the reviewers' and editor's comments and suggestions. Included are the responses to the reviews, detailed list of the changes made to the manuscript, and the revised paper. The present study is the first to report on the longitudinal association of the NEFA composition on the underlying disorders of type 2 diabetes. Given that much of the previous literature on total NEFA and risk for diabetes has been published in Diabetologia, we believe our results will be of interest to your readers.

Thank you for considering our revised manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
