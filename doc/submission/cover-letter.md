Professor Sally Marshall  
Editor-in-Chief  
Diabetologia  

Dear Dr. Marshall,

Attached please find our resubmission of the manuscript entitled, "Association of non-esterified fatty acid composition with insulin sensitivity and beta-cell dysfunction in the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell", which we have revised in light of reviewer comments and like to have considered for publication in Diabetologia. The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere.

We feel our revised manuscript has been strengthened from the reviewer comments and suggestions. Included are the responses to the reviewers and the detailed changes made to the manuscript. The present study is the first to report on the longitudinal association of the NEFA composition on the underlying disorders of type 2 diabetes. Given that much of the previous literature on total NEFA and risk for diabetes has been published in Diabetologia, we believe our results will be of interest to your readers.

Thank you for considering our revised manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
