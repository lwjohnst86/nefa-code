# Details of changes made to manuscript:

- **Title**: Changed title to be more agnostic (as per reviewer 2).
- **Abstract**: Added further detail to methods, results (e.g. cohort
descriptions) (as per reviewer 2) and updated the results in light of the
revised analysis (as suggested by reviewer 2).
- **Introduction**: Added citation to Paris Prospective study (as per AE).
- **Methods** (as suggested by reviewer 2):
    - Changed outcome from HOMA-IR to HOMA2-%S 
    - Added reference to see ESM for formulas for calculating the outcomes
    - Clarified that incident diabetes cases were excluded from the GEE analysis
    - Added references to see ESM figures for the directed acyclic graphs
    - Used time in years since the baseline visit as the time variable in the
    GEE model
    - Revised QIC and directed acyclic graphs for model selection to identify
    which covariate contributed most to differences between unadjusted and
    adjusted GEE models
    - Removed family history of diabetes from the GEE model and replaced with
    physical activity in light of the revised model selection approach and
    results (due to revised QIC and addition of years-since-baseline variable)
    - Clarified that specific covariates (e.g. sex) were time-independent
    - Clarified interpretation of GEE results
    - Added an analysis with the unadjusted GEE models
    - Added sensitivity analyses regarding role of medication use for lipids on
    the NEFA composition and the final results (as per reviewer 1)
    - Dropped the LCMM and PLS-DA analyses, replaced with cross-sectional PLS of
    a continuous outcome
- **Results** (as suggested by reviewer 2):
    - Added mean length of followup
    - Added percent of participants who attended all three visits
    - Clarified interpretation and meaning of the significant decline in the
    outcomes
    - Added number of participants on lipid controlling medications
    - Described findings from the unadjusted GEE models
    - Added description of finding for eicosapentaenoic acid in adjusted models
    - Dropped all results for the LCMM and PLS-DA
    - Briefly described the confirmation of the PLS analysis with the GEE model
    findings
- **Conclusions** (as suggested by reviewer 2 and in light of changes to
analysis and results):
    - Updated overall conclusion based on changes to analysis and results,
    mainly regarding addition of association of eicosapentaenoic acid to insulin
    sensitivity
    - Described, in limitations, the potential for over-adjustment and rationale
    for inclusion of waist circumference in the model
    - Added paragraph expanding on generalizability of findings to other
    populations
    - Added citation to Paris Prospective study
    - Updated interpretation of insulin sensitivity findings regarding
    eicosapentaenoic acid
    - Expanded on discussion on role of waist circumference in the associations
    and findings, particularly with the insulin sensitivity results
- **Figures**: Added figure for the unadjusted GEE models (as per reviewer 2)
- **ESM**: 
    - Added the directed acyclic graphs used in the model selection (as per
reviewer 2)
    - Added correlation heatmap using mol%
    - Updated the QIC table in light of reviewer 2's suggestion to identify
    covariate that contributes to changes in unadjusted and adjusted models as
    well as using years-since-baseline as the time variable
    - Dropped LCMM and PLS-DA figures and results
    - Added figure showing results of GEE models fully adjusted but excluding
    waist circumference
    - Expanded explanation of QIC, directed acyclic graphs, mediators and
    confounders, and on PLS in the ESM methods
