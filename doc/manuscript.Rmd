# Background

Total non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) have been well documented to influence
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Experimental work has shown that
exposure of cells or animals to high concentrations of NEFA can induce insulin
resistance in insulin-sensitive tissue such as the muscle or liver and impair
beta-cell production of insulin, and cause hyperglycemia [@Rachek2014a;@Cnop2008a].
Epidemiological and clinical studies have observed similar findings, showing
that elevated total plasma NEFA associates with risk for diabetes [@Daniele2014a {{more}}].

Most previous experimental work uses palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1n-9),
or a standard oil such as soybean {{confirm, cite}} and generalize as total
NEFA. However, fatty acids comprise multiple classes of molecules with diverse 
physiological functions, with few studies comparing different fatty acids. For
instance, one study on beta-cell {{plates? lines?}} suggests that
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) can protect against the lipotoxic effect of
palmitic acid {{xiao? cite}}.

Prospective with diabetes [@Ilyasova2010a]

Lifestyle interventions aimed at managing or preventing diabetes show a
concomitant reduction in NEFA and insulin resistance {{cite}}.

Lack of longitudinal data is particularly important given that NEFA release from
adipocytes is inhibited by insulin, so if there is IR, more NEFA are released,
making it difficult to disentangle which caused which.

Despite the fairly extensive literature on NEFA and diabetes, there are
substantial research gaps. Importantly, most of the experimental work using
individual NEFA species has been in animal and cell lines or if in humans has
been acute, infusion studies. For epidemiological studies, few have examined the
role of total, but not individual, NEFA on the pathogenesis of diabetes and
fewer still have been longitudinal, which is key to understanding causal
associations and given the long timescale in diabetes pathophysiology.
Presently, no longitudinal study has been conducted that has examined the role
of the composition of the NEFA fraction on the pathogenesis of diabetes. Our
research objective was to examine the role of the NEFA composition
on insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function using longitudinal and clustering
techniques. Some specific hypotheses included that higher palmitic acid while
lower polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid would associate
with lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function.

# Subjects and Methods

Participants from London and Toronto, Canada, were recruited into the 
Prospective Metabolism and Islet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort. Eligibility 
for recruitment into PROMISE included having one or more risk factors for type 2
diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, hypertension, family history of diabetes, 
and/or a history of gestational diabetes or birth of a macrosomic infant. 
Participants aged 30 years and older (n=726) conducted the baseline visit
between 2004-2006. Follow-up examinations occur every three years, with three
examination visits completed to date (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2013).  The
current study used data on participants who did not have diabetes at baseline,
who returned for one or more follow-up examinations, and who had samples
available for fatty acid measurements (n=477).  A diagram of the sample size at
each visit is shown in `r cite_sf('consort')`.  At each examination,
participants undergo metabolic characterization, anthropometric measurements,
and questionnaires on lifestyle and sociodemographics.  Research ethics approval
was obtained from Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario. 
Data collection methods were standardized across the 2 centres and research
nurses were centrally trained. 

## Blood measure assessments

At each examination, an 8-12 hour fasting blood sample was draw from each
participant, followed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 30
minute and 2 hour blood draw. All blood samples were processed and frozen at
-70°C. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured using standard laboratory
procedures. Cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides (TG) were measured using Roche
Modular's enzymatic colometric tests (Mississauga, ON).  Both specific insulin
and glucose were derived from the OGTT at fasting, 30 minute, and 2 hour time
points. Specific insulin was measured using the Elecsys 1010 (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay. This assay shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to intact human pro-insulin
and the Des 31,32 circulating split form (Linco Res. Inc), and has a CV of 9.3%.
Glucose was determined using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular, Roche
Diagnostics) with a detection range of 0.11 (2 mg/dL) to 41.6 mmol/L.  The
inter-assay %CV is <1.1% and intra-assay %CV is < 1.9%.  All assays were
performed at the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre Core Lab at the University of
Toronto. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and
diabetes were categorized using the 2006 WHO criteria [@WHO2006].

NEFA composition was quantified using stored fasting serum samples from the 
baseline visit, which had been frozen at -70°C for 4-6 years and had not been 
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles.  Serum fatty acids have been documented to be
stable at these temperatures for up to 10 years [@Matthan2010a]. A known amount 
of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) {{confirm}} was added to the serum as an internal 
standard prior to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch 
[@Folch1957a].  Each serum lipid fraction was isolated using thin layer 
chromatography, which were visualized under UV light after lightly spraying with
8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (0.1% wt/vol) and then converted to fatty
acid methyl esters with 14% boron trifluoride in methanol at 100°C for 1 h. 
Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and quantified using a Varian-430 gas
chromatograph (Varian, Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a Varian Factor Four
capillary column and a flame ionization detector, which were injected in
splitless mode. Fatty acid concentrations (nmol/ml) were calculated by
proportional comparison of gas chromatography peak areas to that of the internal
standards [@Nishi2014a; @Chen2011a].  There were 22 fatty acids measured in the
NEFA fraction.

## Outcome variables

Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function indices were computed using the OGTT 
glucose and insulin.  Insulin sensitivity was assessed using 1/HOMA-IR (1
divided by HOMA-IR) [@Matthews1985] and the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI)
[@Matsuda1999]. HOMA-IR largely reflects hepatic insulin resistance, while ISI
reflects whole-body insulin sensitivity [@AbdulGhani2007].  Beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic Index [@Wareham1995] over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR)
and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) [@Retnakaran2009]. IGI/IR
is a measure of the first phase insulin secretion while ISSI-2 is analogous to
the disposition index. Each index has been validated against gold standard
measures [@Matthews1985; @Matsuda1999; @Retnakaran2009].

## Anthropometrics and sociodemographics

Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at all clinic 
examinations using standard procedures.  WC was measured at the natural waist, 
defined as the narrowest part of the torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid
process. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m) squared.
Sociodemographic information, such as age, sex, and ethnicity, were determined
using questionnaires administered at each examination. In the lifestyle
questionnaire, physical activity was determined using a version of the
Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) [@Kriska1990].  The MAQ collects 
information on leisure and occupational activity, including intensity, 
frequency, and duration, over the past year.  Each reported activity from the 
MAQ was weighted by its metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of 
MET-hours per week.

## Statistical analysis

The primary outcome variables for the PROMISE cohort and this analyses were 
1/HOMA-IR, ISI, IGI/IR, and ISSI-2; outcome variables were log-transformed for
the statistical modeling. The primary predictor variables for this study were
the 22 NEFA as a mole percent (mol%) of the total fraction and as a 
concentration (nmol/mL). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the
individual NEFA and with other continuous variables.

For the primary analysis, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models 
[@Zeger1986a] were used to determine the longitudinal associations between the 
outcome variables and the predictor variables.  Given the longitudinal design 
and auto-regressive (AR1) correlation matrix was chosen for the GEE models, 
though other matrices (eg. exchangeable) had similar fit (data not shown). GEE
is well suited to cohort studies given it's capacity to handle missed visits.
The predictor variables and continuous covariates were scaled (mean centered and
standardized). The NEFA variables were classified as *time-independent* (held
constant) as they were measured only at the baseline visit, while the outcome
variables and covariates were set as *time-dependent*. No imputation was
conducted on missing values.

Covariates selection was based on previous literature, directed acyclic graph 
[@Greenland1999a] recommendations, and quasi-likelihood information criterion 
(QIC). `r cite_st('qic')` shows the covariates compared using QIC and `r 
cite_sf('dag')` shows the specified directed acyclic graph. The final GEE model 
we selected differed between insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function models. 
For insulin sensitivity, we adjusted for time, sex, ethnicity, baseline age, WC,
ALT, MET, alcohol intake, and family history of diabetes (M6). For beta-cell
function, the last few models were comparable in performance, so we chose the
simplest model (M8), adjusting for time, sex, ethnicity, baseline age, WC, ALT,
and family history of diabetes. After scaling, log-transforming, and
exponentiating the GEE estimates, the GEE results are interpreted as an expected
percent difference in the outcome variable for every SD increase in the
predictor variable given the covariates are held constant. While models with a
time interaction did not perform better than others for the QIC (M6.1 and M8.1
in `r cite_st('qic')`, we ran models with a time by predictor term for each of
the NEFA to test if there was a time interaction. Given that TG is a risk factor
for diabetes and that NEFA contribute to TG production, TG may act as a mediator
between NEFA and the outcomes. However, only a subset of the participants at the
6-yr visit had clinically measured TG. To determine the role of TG in the
association between NEFA and the outcomes, TG was included in the GEE model as a
sensitivity analysis.

While GEE controls for the longitudinal design of the data, a limitation is that
it can not analyze the inherent multivariate nature of the composition of the 
NEFA fraction. As such, after running the GEE models for the longitudinal 
analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to
identify the patterns of NEFA composition against beta-cell function (using ISSI-2,
which has most of the associations in the GEE models). Since PLS-DA can't handle
longitudinal data, the longitudinal data was maximized by extracting latent
trajectories of beta-cell function over the 6 years using latent class mixed
models (LCMM). A limitation of these methods is that they can not be adjusted
for covariates.

All analyses were performed using R `r getRversion()` [@Rbase], along with the R
packages geepack `r packageVersion('geepack')` for GEE [@Hoejsgaard2006a], caret
`r packageVersion('caret')` for PLS-DA, and lcmm `r packageVersion('lcmm')` for
LCMM. The R code for this manuscript is available at {{link}}. Results were
statistically significance at p<0.05, after adjusting for multiple testing using
the False Discovery Rate [@Benjamini1995a].

## Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort

The primary outcome variables had a median decline between 
`r percent.change.outcomes` over the 6 years in this subset of the PROMISE cohort.

`r cite_f('nefaDist')` shows the distribution of the NEFA composition. Four 
individual NEFA made up the vast majority (`r sum(pct_nefa$pct)`%) of the total
NEFA fraction. The largest contributors were `r pctne$c[1]`, `r pctne$c[2]`, 
`r pctne$c[3]`, and `r pctne$c[4]`. All individual NEFA as well as the total
fraction had weak to no correlations (r<0.3) with the basic characteristics (see
`r cite_sf('corr')`).

## GEE modeling

Several associations were seen in the unadjusted GEE models 
(`r cite_sf('gee')`), particularly for the concentration data. Full model
adjustment attenuated most of these associations, where total NEFA, 16:0, and
18:2n-6 (all as nmol/mL) had negative associations between IGI/IR and ISSI-2
(see `r cite_f('gee')`). The magnitude of association for each of these
variables was fairly consistent for each beta-cell function measure. For every
one SD decrease in any of these three NEFA variables, there was a predicted
{{magnitude}}% lower IGI/IR and a {{magnitude}}% lower ISSI-2 at each clinic
visit. None of the NEFA variables as a mol% had any association with the
outcomes. Adjusting for TG attenuates all associations with IGI/IR and ISSI-2
(data not shown), though sample size at the 6 year visit is restricted to n=128
in those who had TG measured. There were no significant interaction effects
between time and the individual NEFA on any of the outcome measures (data not
shown). Raw values from the GEE models are shown in `r cite_st('gee_unadj')` for
unadjusted models and `r cite_st('gee')` for fully adjusted models.

## Latent trajectory and NEFA pattern recognition

Three latent classes were extracted from LCMM, with `r lcmm_grps[2,2]` 
participants in the high, `r lcmm_grps[1,2]` in the middle, and `lcmm_grps[3,2]`
in the low beta-cell function groups. The trajectories of the three groups are
shown in `r cite_sf('lcmm')`. These groups were used as the response variables
in the PLS-DA analysis. The PLS-DA results show a very poor discriminatory
abililty of the NEFA composition in classifying participants into the correct
beta-cell function latent class. Only `r misclass_npct[2,1]` 
(`r misclass_npct[2,4]`) participants were correctly classified, primarily into the
middle group. The specific NEFA composition was not able to accurately classify
participants who had low or high beta-cell function.
`r cite_sf('plsda_loadings')` shows the loadings of individual NEFA by the
extracted component and `r cite_sf('plsda_groups')` shows the clustering of the
components by ISSI-2 latent class.

# Discussion

In a Canadian population of adults who are at-risk for diabetes, we found that
higher total NEFA independently predicted a lower beta-cell function over 6
years. In particular, the specific composition of the NEFA fraction had no
association with any of the metabolic outcomes within this cohort. These
findings suggest that the size of the total fraction, rather than the
composition, influences the pathogenesis of diabetes.
Given we found associations with the nmol/mL data, but none in the mol% data,
this suggests to us that the total size of the NEFA fraction is more important
in the pathogenesis of diabetes than is the specific FA composition. A
limitation of the mol% data is the inherent dependency between the FA as an
increase in one FA by definition means other FA must decrease. In the context of
this dependency, the associations we found for 16:0 and 18:2n-6 as nmol/mL
suggests that these NEFA may be contributing to the harmful association seen for
the total NEFA fraction, irrespective of changes in the other NEFA.

While future studies are needed to confirm these findings, our results suggest
that measurement of the NEFA composition may not be warranted and that the
simple, easy to measure total NEFA may be the measure most appropriate for
further analysis. {{reword}}

The role of total NEFA on diabetes is a well-studied area of research.
Epidemiology study showing that higher NEFA in both adults and children 
associate with lower insulin secretion [@Salgin2012a]. Also show an association 
with higher risk for developing IGT or diabetes after approximately 6 years in 
adults [@Salgin2012a].
In a cross-sectional analysis of the RISCK cohort, total NEFA had a negative
association with insulin sensitivity and, particularly strong with beta-cell
function [@Johns2014a]. The authors' further analysis suggested that greater
adiposity was likely not a mediator between the total NEFA and metabolic
function association.
{{[@Giacca2011a;@Xiao2009a]}}.
This is the first study to our knowledge to examine a broad spectrum of
individual NEFA in a cohort setting on beta-cell function. We found that
individual NEFA as mol% or of the NEFA composition overall had any association
or predictive power on determining beta-cell function, but there was a very
strong signal with total NEFA, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid as
concentrations.
Potential mechanisms for the role of NEFA on beta-cell function are well
described experimentally, particularly for palmitic acid. Prolonged exposure to
the elevated NEFA can induce apoptosis in the beta-cells, likely through 
endoplasmic reticulum stress, formation of ceramides, and generation of nitric 
oxide, as well as can impair proinsulin production and mitochrondial function 
[@Cnop2008a; @Maris2013a; @Carpentier2003a].

In the sensitivity analysis adjusting for TAG, all associations with beta-cell 
function were attenuated. While there is strong experimental evidence on the 
role of chronically elevated NEFA, particularly palmitic acid, on impaired 
beta-cell function, within a free-living population NEFA may be mediating it's 
association through TAG. In normal metabolism, NEFA enters the liver and assists
in the production of TAG that is to be processed into very-low density 
lipoproteins (VLDL) [@Nielsen2012a]. Elevated NEFA may be mediating it's
association through hypertriglyceridemia, a known risk factor for diabetes.
However, a major limitation to the TAG-adjusted GEE models is the reduced sample
size in the 6 year visit, as only a subset (n=128) of participants had TAG
measured.

There is substantial experimental evidence highlighting the role of increased 
NEFA and a subsequent increase in insulin resistance via impairment of insulin 
signaling cascades (reviewed in multiple articles 
[@Martins2012a;@Ebbert2013a;@Capurso2012a;@Surampudi2009]). However, in this
longitudinal analysis, we saw no association between any individual or total
NEFA and neither hepatic (1/HOMA-IR) nor whole-body insulin sensitivity (ISI). 
There are some possible explanations for our findings. Previous studies done *in
vivo* were mostly short term infusion 
[@Xiao2009a;@Xiao2006;@Szendroedi2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a] or pharmocologic
[@Daniele2014a;@Liang2013a] trials and the observational research was generally
cross-sectional [@Miller2012a;@Johns2014a;@Bush2012a]. The limitation of these
studies were the short time periods examined and the experimentally-induced
elevations in NEFA concentrations, making it difficult to assess the causal role
in non-experimental environments over long time frames. Moreover, some studies
have found null or weak associations of NEFA and IR 
[@Gray2013a;@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a;@Johns2014a], suggesting that either
NEFA only have a minor role in IR or that NEFA is the effect, but not cause, of
the underlying IR. Adipose tissue, which release NEFA during fasting, can become
insulin resistant and thus lipolysis of intracellular TAG by hormone-sensitive 
lipase may not respond to the inhibitory action of insulin. As such, IR may 
develop before elevations in blood NEFA. There is also evidence to suggest that 
insulin may be involved in NEFA uptake [@Ramos-Roman2012a], further supporting 
the hypothesis that elevated NEFA is a consequence of higher IR.

There are two other possible explanations for our null findings for the insulin
sensitivity measures. First, there may be differences in physiology between
fasting and postprandial NEFA kinetics. For instance, some experimental studies
using the clamp found that fasting NEFA was a weak predictor of insulin
sensitivity compared to postprandial concentrations of NEFA
[@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a]. Inefficiencies in NEFA uptake into the adipose
tissue following postprandial TAG lipolysis via lipoprotein lipase may result in
NEFA spillover into the blood and a subsequent increase in circulating NEFA
[@Almandoz2013a], which may be more metabolically active given postprandial 
activity. Second, the null findings may be due to the high risk population
examined. It may be that in this population, IR has become well established and
the role of NEFA may no longer be evaluated in this context.

This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the composition of the NEFA
fraction and longitudinal measures of metabolic functioning. A recent, well
analyzed study used a variety of advanced statistical techniques to explore the
multivariate relationship between the NEFA composition and components of the
metabolic syndrome (MetS) [@Dai2015a]. Specifically, using the statistical techniques,
the authors identified the NEFA 16:1n-9, 20:1n-9, and 22:4n-6 to most correlate
with components of the MetS. Another statistically similar studied diabetes
specifically and found that 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3 may be useful
biomarkers for identifying healthy compared to diabetic individuals [@Liu2010a].
However, a limitation of both these studies were the smaller sample sizes
(approximately 100 subjects) and the cross-sectional design. 

There are a few important limitations to our study. NEFA were only quantified at
the baseline visit and as such we can not investigate whether there were 
concomitant changes in NEFA and the metabolic measures. However, we believe this
is a strength for our specific objective, as the chance of reverse causality is 
reduced given that fatty acid and glucose metabolism pathways are tightly 
integrated. This is also an observational cohort, and there may be some residual
confounding we haven't considered or that couldn't be measured. Nonetheless, we 
were as thorough as possible in understanding and minimizing potential 
confounding. Finally, our cohort consists of individuals at-risk for diabetes, 
who are primarily female of European-ancestry and as such our results may not be
generalizable to other populations. However, given these limitations, our study
also has several strengths, including the longitudinal design and the rigorous
statistical techniques and methods applied, which are specifically suited to
investigating temporal relationships and to handling the multivariate nature of
the data. In addition, our cohort contains highly detailed and comprehensive
variable measurements at each collection visit, and has both concentration and
mol% data for the fatty acids.

Final, brief conclusion...
In conclusion, we found that NEFA
While future studies are needed to confirm these findings, our results suggest
that measurement of the NEFA composition may not be warranted and that the
simple, easy to measure total NEFA may be the measure most appropriate for
further analysis. {{reword}}

Given the number of possible combinations of outcome and predictor variables,
only ISI and ISSI-2 with total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) were used to
compare various GEE models and to select a final model.  Baseline age was used
as including both the original age and the time variable would result in
collinearity.  Column names: QIC is the quasi-likelihood information criteria
(smaller values, eg. larger negative values, indicate a better fit compared to
other models), Delta is the QIC minus the lowest QIC (models with delta <10 are 
considered equivalent).  Models were:

- M0: log(ISSI-2) or log(ISI) = total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) + time
- M1: M0 + waist + sex + ethnicity + baseline age
- M2: M1 + ALT
- M3: M2 + physical activity
- M4: M3 + alcohol intake
- M5: M4 + family history of diabetes
- M6: M5 + smoking status
- M6.1: M6 + time by NEFA interaction
- M7: M2 + family history of diabetes + smoking status
- M8: M2 + family history of diabetes
- M8.1: M8 + time by NEFA interaction
