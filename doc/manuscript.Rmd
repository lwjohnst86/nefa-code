# Abstract
248 / 250 words

Objective: Our aim was to determine the longitudinal associations of individual
non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) on changes in insulin sensitivity (IS) and
beta-cell function over 6 years in a cohort of individuals who are at-risk for
diabetes.

Research Design and Methods: In the PROMISE cohort, 477 participants had serum
NEFA measured at the baseline visit and who had completed an OGTT at 3 time
points over 6 years. Outcome variables were calculated using the OGTT values.
IS was assessed using 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index, while beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the Insulin
Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2). Generalized estimating equations were
used, adjusting for time, waist, sex, ethnicity, age, ALT, alcohol intake,
physical activity, and family history of diabetes. NEFA were analyzed as both
concentrations and proportions (mol%) of the total fraction.

Results: IS and beta-cell function declined by 14-27% while BMI
did not significantly change over 6 years of follow-up. Total NEFA, 16:0,
18:1n-9, and 18:2n-6 as concentrations had significant negative associations
with IGI/IR and ISSI-2, predicting between 4-8% lower IGI/IR and ISSI-2 over the
6 years. However, individual NEFA modeled as mol% showed no associations with
these outcomes. Total and individual NEFA were not associated with IS measures.

Conclusions: Total NEFA concentration was a strong predictor of lower beta-cell
function over 6 years. Our results suggest that the association with beta-cell
function is due to the absolute size of the serum NEFA fraction, rather than the
specific fatty acid composition.

# Background

Total non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) have been well documented to influence 
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Experimental work has shown that 
exposure to high concentrations of NEFA can induce insulin resistance in 
insulin-sensitive tissues such as muscle and liver, and in addition can impair 
pancreatic beta-cell production of insulin [@Rachek2014a;@Cnop2008a].
Observational and clinical studies have reported concordant findings, showing
in particular that elevated total plasma NEFA associates with an increased risk
for incident type 2 diabetes [@Daniele2014a;@Salgin2012a].

Much of the previous experimental work on the role of NEFA in type 2 diabetes
utilized individual fatty acids such as palmitic acid (16:0) or oleic acid
(18:1n-9), or alternatively used specific oils such as soybean oil, which is
high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid (18:2n-6), as the
exposure to characterize the impact of total NEFA. However, fatty acids comprise
multiple molecules with diverse physiological functions, and few 
studies have analyzed the effects of a broader spectrum of fatty acids. Notably,
one study suggests that eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) can protect against the
lipotoxic effect of palmitic acid in the beta-cells [@Xiao2006].

Despite a sizable literature studying the role of total NEFA concentration in 
diabetes, there are important gaps in this research. The majority of previous 
studies have used animal models or cell lines [@Szendroedi2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a], 
have been short term human infusion trials [@Daniele2014a;@Liang2013a], or have
been epidemiological studies that only looked at total NEFA and not individual
fatty acids [@Miller2012a;@Johns2014a]. To date, there have
been no longitudinal studies examining the role of the composition of the serum NEFA
fraction on the pathogenesis of diabetes, which is critical to
understanding associations at a more granular level given the protracted natural
history of diabetes and the growing appreciation of the divergent effects of
individual fatty acids. Therefore, our objective was to examine the 
association of serum NEFA composition on changes over time in insulin
sensitivity and beta-cell function in a longitudinal cohort. We hypothesized
that higher palmitic acid and lower polyunsaturated fatty acids such as
eicosapentaenoic acid would associate with declining insulin sensitivity and
beta-cell function over 6 years.

# Subjects and Methods

Participants from London and Toronto, Canada, were recruited into the 
Prospective Metabolism and Islet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort. Eligibility 
for recruitment into PROMISE required having one or more risk factors for type 2
diabetes mellitus, including obesity, hypertension, family history of diabetes, 
and/or a history of gestational diabetes or birth of a macrosomic infant. 
Participants aged 30 years and older (n=736) attended the baseline visit
between 2004-2006. Follow-up examinations in this cohort occur every three years, with three
examination visits completed to date (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2013).  The
current study used data on participants who did not have diabetes at baseline,
who returned for one or more follow-up examinations, and who had samples
available for fatty acid measurements (n=477). A diagram of the sample size at
each visit is shown in `r cite_sf('consort')`. At each examination,
participants undergo metabolic characterization, anthropometric measurements,
and questionnaires on lifestyle and sociodemographics. Research ethics approval
was obtained from Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario,
and all participants provided written informed consent.
Data collection methods were standardized across the 2 centres and research
nurses were centrally trained. 

## Blood measure assessments

At each examination, an 8-12 hour fasting blood sample was draw from each
participant, followed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 30
minute and 2 hour blood draw. All blood samples were processed and frozen at
-70°C. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured using standard laboratory
procedures. Cholesterol, HDL, and triacylglycerides (TAG) were measured using Roche
Modular's enzymatic colorimetric tests (Mississauga, ON).  Both specific insulin
and glucose were derived from the OGTT at fasting, 30 minute, and 2 hour time
points. Specific insulin was measured using the Elecsys 1010 (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay. This assay shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to intact human pro-insulin
and the Des 31,32 circulating split form (Linco Res. Inc), and has a CV of 9.3%.
Glucose was determined using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular, Roche
Diagnostics) with a detection range of 0.11 (2 mg/dL) to 41.6 mmol/L.  The
inter-assay %CV is <1.1% and intra-assay %CV is < 1.9%.  All assays were
performed at the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre Core Lab at Mt Sinai Hospital.
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and diabetes
were categorized using the 2006 WHO criteria [@WHO2006].

NEFA composition was quantified using stored fasting serum samples from the 
baseline visit, which had been frozen at -70°C for 4-6 years and had not been 
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles. Serum fatty acids have been documented to be
stable at these temperatures for up to 10 years [@Matthan2010a]. A known amount 
of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) was added to the serum as an internal 
standard prior to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch 
[@Folch1957a]. Each serum lipid fraction (NEFA, cholesteryl ester, phospholipid,
and TAG) was isolated using thin layer chromatography; each fraction was
visualized under UV light after lightly spraying with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene
sulfonic acid (0.1% wt/vol) and then converted to fatty acid methyl esters with
14% boron trifluoride in methanol at 100°C for 1 h. Fatty acid methyl esters
were separated and quantified using a Varian-430 gas chromatograph (Varian, Lake
Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a Varian Factor Four capillary column and a flame
ionization detector, which were injected in splitless mode. Fatty acid
concentrations (nmol/ml) were calculated by proportional comparison of gas
chromatography peak areas to that of the internal standards [@Nishi2014a]. 
There were 22 fatty acids measured in the NEFA fraction. Given their
diverse biology, as well as the complexity of the analyses, findings for other lipid
fractions in this cohort are reported separately (see [@Johnston2016a] for the
analysis of the phospholipid and cholesteryl ester fractions).

## Outcome variables

Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function indices were computed using the OGTT 
glucose and insulin data. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using 1/HOMA-IR (1
divided by HOMA-IR) [@Matthews1985] and the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI)
[@Matsuda1999]. HOMA-IR largely reflects hepatic insulin resistance, while ISI
reflects whole-body insulin sensitivity [@AbdulGhani2007].  Beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic Index [@Wareham1995] over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR)
and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) [@Retnakaran2009]. IGI/IR
is a measure of the first phase insulin secretion while ISSI-2 is analogous to
the disposition index (but using OGTT values). Each index has been validated
against gold standard measures [@Matthews1985; @Matsuda1999; @Retnakaran2009].

## Anthropometrics and sociodemographics

Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at all clinic 
examinations using standard procedures.  WC was measured at the natural waist, 
defined as the narrowest part of the torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid
process. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m) squared.
Sociodemographic information, including age, sex, and ethnicity, were determined
using questionnaires administered at each examination. In the lifestyle
questionnaire, physical activity was determined using a version of the
Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) [@Kriska1990].  The MAQ collects 
information on leisure and occupational activity, including intensity, 
frequency, and duration, over the past year.  Each reported activity from the 
MAQ was weighted by its metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of 
MET-hours per week.

## Statistical analysis

The primary outcome variables for this analysis were 
1/HOMA-IR, ISI, IGI/IR, and ISSI-2; outcome variables were log-transformed for
the statistical modeling. The primary predictor variables for this analysis were
22 individual NEFA as mole percent (mol%) of the total fraction and as
concentration (nmol/mL). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to
assess the relationships of individual NEFA with other continuous variables.

For the primary analysis, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models 
[@Zeger1986a] were used to determine the longitudinal associations between the 
outcome variables and the predictor variables. Given the longitudinal design 
an auto-regressive of order 1 (AR1) correlation matrix was chosen for the GEE models, 
though other matrices (eg. exchangeable) had similar fit (data not shown). GEE
is well suited to longitudinal cohort studies given it's capacity to handle
missed visits. The predictor variables and continuous covariates were scaled
(mean centered and standardized). The NEFA variables were classified as
*time-independent* (held constant) as they were measured only at the baseline
visit, while the outcome variables and covariates were set as *time-dependent*.
No imputation was conducted on missing values.

Covariate selection was based on previous literature, directed acyclic graph 
[@Greenland1999a] recommendations, and quasi-likelihood information criterion 
(QIC). `r cite_st('qic')` shows the covariates compared using QIC and 
`r cite_sf('dag')` shows the specified directed acyclic graph. The final GEE model 
we selected differed between insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function models. 
For insulin sensitivity, we adjusted for time, sex, ethnicity, baseline age, WC,
ALT, MET, alcohol intake, and family history of diabetes (M6). For beta-cell
function, the last four models (M5-M8) were comparable in performance, therefore we
report results from the simplest model (M8), adjusting for time, sex, ethnicity,
baseline age, WC, ALT,
and family history of diabetes. After scaling, log-transforming, and
exponentiating the GEE estimates, the GEE results are interpreted as an expected
percent difference in the outcome variable for every SD increase in the
predictor variable given the covariates are held constant. While we decided *a priori*
to test for and report on the time by predictor interaction results, we
also assessed the overall fit of models that included a time interaction, which
ultimately did not improve the overall fit of our models in terms of QIC
(M6.1 and M8.1 as seen
in `r cite_st('qic')`) and we therefore did not include them in the main effect
analysis. Given that TAG is a risk factor
for diabetes and that NEFA contribute to TAG production, TAG may act as a mediator
between NEFA and the outcomes. To determine the role of TAG in the
association between NEFA and the outcomes, TAG was included in the GEE model as a
sensitivity analysis. Lastly for the GEE models, we tested for an interaction
with sex or ethnicity by the predictor term for each outcome variable.

While GEE accounts for the longitudinal design of the data, this approach is
limited in that it cannot analyze the inherent multivariate nature of the
composition of the NEFA fraction. As such, after running the GEE models for the
longitudinal analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was
used to identify the patterns of NEFA composition against beta-cell function
(using ISSI-2, which had the majority of the significant associations in the GEE models) and for
those who converted to or maintained dysglycemia status (either IFG, IGT, or DM)
over the 6 years. Since PLS-DA cannot handle longitudinal data, latent class
mixed models (LCMM) were used to extract latent trajectories of beta-cell
function (ISSI-2) over the 6 years.

All analyses were performed using R `r getRversion()` [@Rbase], along with the R
packages geepack `r packageVersion('geepack')` for GEE <!--[@Hoejsgaard2006a]-->, caret
`r packageVersion('caret')` for PLS-DA, and lcmm `r packageVersion('lcmm')` for
LCMM. The R code for this manuscript is available at {{add link before
submission}}. Results were considered statistically significance at p<0.05,
after adjusting for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg False
Discovery Rate [@Benjamini1995a].

## Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort

For this study, there were 
`r sex.npct$npct` females and `r ethn.npct$npct` had European-ancestry.
The average age of the participants was `r aide::average(ds0yr$Age)` years 
(`r aide::stddev(ds0yr$Age)` SD) and the average BMI was
`r aide::average(ds0yr$BMI)` (`r aide::stddev(ds0yr$BMI)` SD). Most of the 
participants, `r fhd.npct$npct`, had a family history of diabetes.
The primary outcome variables showed a significant median decline between 
`r percent.change.outcomes$chg` (p`r percent.change.outcomes$p`) over the 6
years in this analysis of the PROMISE cohort.
Consistent with this decline, there were `r dm.convert`
participants who developed diabetes while `r predm.convert` participants either
converted to or maintained IFG or IGT status over the 6 years.

`r cite_f('nefaDist')` shows the compositional distribution of NEFA in the study
participants. Four individual NEFA made up the vast majority 
(`r sum(percent.nefa$pct)`%) of the total NEFA fraction. The largest contributors
were `r percent.nefa$c[1]`, `r percent.nefa$c[2]`, `r percent.nefa$c[3]`, and 
`r percent.nefa$c[4]`. Raw concentration values are shown in `r cite_st('nefaDist')`. 
All individual NEFA as well as the total fraction had
correlations that ranged from weak to null (r<0.3) with participant
characteristics (see `r cite_sf('corr')`).

## GEE modeling

A number of associations were seen in the unadjusted GEE models 
(see `r cite_sf('gee')`), particularly for NEFA modeled as a concentration.
Full model adjustment (`r cite_f('gee')`) attenuated most of these
associations, although total NEFA, 16:0, 18:1n-9, and 18:2n-6 (all as nmol/mL)
had negative associations with
IGI/IR and ISSI-2. The magnitude of association for each of these variables was
fairly consistent for each beta-cell function measure. For every one SD increase
in any of these three NEFA variables, there was an average predicted
`r est.gee$est[1]`% lower IGI/IR and `r est.gee$est[2]`% lower ISSI-2 at each
clinic visit. However, in contrast to these results using NEFA modeled as concentrations, none of the NEFA variables modeled as mol% were associated with the
outcomes. Adjusting for TAG attenuated all associations with IGI/IR and ISSI-2
(data not shown).
There were no significant interaction effects
between time, sex, or ethnicity and the individual NEFA on any of the outcome
measures (all p>0.15). Raw values from the GEE models are shown in 
`r cite_st('gee')` for fully adjusted models and `r cite_st('gee_unadj')` for unadjusted models.

## Latent trajectory and NEFA pattern recognition

Three latent classes were extracted from LCMM, with `r lcmm.groups$Freq[2]` 
participants in the high, `r lcmm.groups$Freq[1]` in the middle, and 
`r lcmm.groups$Freq[3]`
in the low beta-cell function groups. The trajectories of the these groups are
shown in `r cite_sf('lcmm')`. These groups were used as the beta-cell function
response variables in the PLS-DA analysis. The PLS-DA results show a very poor
discriminatory ability of the NEFA composition in classifying participants into
the correct beta-cell function latent class. Only 
`r misclass.n.percent.bcf$NPct[2]` 
participants were correctly classified, primarily into the
middle group. The specific NEFA composition was not able to accurately classify
participants who had low or high beta-cell function, however, those individuals 
classified into the low beta-cell function group tended to have patterns of NEFA 
composition higher in 14:0, 16:0, 14:1n-7, and 16:1n-7.
`r cite_sf('plsda_loadings')` shows the loadings of individual NEFA by the
extracted component and `r cite_sf('plsda_groups')` shows the clustering of
the components by ISSI-2 latent class. The PLS-DA analysis using conversion to
or maintenance of dysglycemia status over the 6 years as the response variable showed similar
poor discriminatory ability, though better than the beta-cell function
trajectory results. While `r misclass.n.percent.dysgly$NPct[2]` participants 
were classified correctly based on dysglycemia status, this was almost entirely
due to classifying correctly into the non-dysglycemia status. Examining the
clustering of the NEFA composition showed poor discrimination between groups
(see `r cite_sf('plsda_groups_dysgly')` and 
`r cite_sf('plsda_loadings_dysgly')`).

# Discussion

In a Canadian population of adults who are at-risk for diabetes, we found that
higher total NEFA concentrations independently predicted
lower beta-cell function after 6 years. While we found negative associations with
palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1n-9), and
linoleic acid (18:2n-6) for the concentration (nmol/mL) modeling, no
associations were seen for the proportion of these fatty acids and further
clustering analysis found no predictive ability of these individual NEFA on
beta-cell function or dysglycemia. These observations suggest that the absolute
size of the total NEFA fraction, rather than its specific composition, likely
influences the pathogenesis of diabetes.

The role of total NEFA in the etiology of diabetes is well-documented.
Epidemiological studies have shown that higher NEFA associate with lower insulin
secretion and a higher risk for developing diabetes 
[@Salgin2012a;@Pankow2004a]. In a cross-sectional analysis of the RISCK cohort,
total NEFA had a negative association with insulin sensitivity and a
particularly strong negative association with beta-cell function [@Johns2014a].
Experimentally, several potential mechanisms have been elucidated for the role
of NEFA on beta-cell function, particularly for palmitic acid. Prolonged
exposure to elevated NEFA can induce apoptosis in the beta-cells, possibly
through endoplasmic reticulum stress, formation of ceramides, and generation of
nitric oxide, as well as impairment of proinsulin production and mitochondrial
function [@Cnop2008a; @Maris2013a; @Giacca2011a; @Xiao2009a].
The present analysis is the first study to our knowledge to examine the 
longitudinal association of a broad spectrum of individual NEFA on
beta-cell function in a large cohort. We found that there was a strong signal of
higher total NEFA, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid modeled as
concentrations with lower beta-cell function. However, in modeling these fatty
acids as a mol% and using novel clustering analysis approaches, no specific
fatty acids in the NEFA fraction strongly predicted lower beta-cell
function, insulin sensitivity, or dysglycemia status. Taken together, these
results suggest that it is the absolute size of the circulating NEFA fraction,
irrespective of any specific composition of fatty acids, that is
responsible for the hypothesized lipotoxic effects of NEFA on the beta-cells.

Biologically, in free-living populations chronic elevation of NEFA may be 
mediating it's association with metabolic outcomes through TAG. In normal
metabolism, NEFA enters the
liver and assists in the production of TAG that is to be processed into very-low
density lipoproteins (VLDL) [@Nielsen2012a]. As such, higher NEFA may contribute 
to hypertriglyceridemia, which is a known risk factor for diabetes. In the
sensitivity analysis adjusting for TAG, all associations with beta-cell function
were attenuated, suggesting that NEFA may in fact be mediating it's association
with beta-cell dysfunction through higher TAG.

There is substantial experimental evidence highlighting the role of increased 
NEFA and the subsequent increase in insulin resistance via impairment of insulin 
signaling cascades, as reviewed in previously published articles 
[@Martins2012a;@Ebbert2013a;@Capurso2012a]. However, in this
longitudinal analysis, we saw no association of any individual or total
NEFA with hepatic (1/HOMA-IR) or whole-body insulin sensitivity (ISI). 
There are several possible explanations for these findings. Previous studies
done *in vivo* were mostly short term infusion protocols
[@Xiao2009a;@Xiao2006;@Szendroedi2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a] or pharmocologic
[@Daniele2014a;@Liang2013a] trials and previous observational research was generally
cross-sectional or correlational
[@Miller2012a;@Johns2014a;@Bush2012a;@Ilyasova2010a]. The short time periods of
these studies and the experimentally-induced
elevations in NEFA concentrations make it difficult to assess the causal role
in free-living environments over long time frames. Moreover, some studies
have found null or weak associations of NEFA and IR 
[@Gray2013a;@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a;@Johns2014a], suggesting that either
NEFA has only a minor role in IR or that NEFA is the effect, but not cause, of
the underlying IR. Adipose tissue, which release NEFA during fasting, can become
insulin resistant and thus lipolysis of intracellular TAG by hormone-sensitive 
lipase may not respond to the inhibitory action of insulin. As such, IR may 
develop before elevations in blood NEFA. There is also evidence to suggest that 
insulin may be involved in NEFA uptake [@Ramos-Roman2012a], further supporting 
the hypothesis that elevated NEFA may be a consequence of higher IR. However, we 
could not examine this potential hypothesis as NEFA was only collected at the
baseline visit.

There are two other possible explanations for our null findings for the insulin
sensitivity measures. First, there may be differences in physiology between
fasting and postprandial NEFA kinetics. For instance, some experimental studies
using clamp protocols found that fasting NEFA was a weak predictor of insulin
sensitivity compared to postprandial concentrations of NEFA
[@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a]. Inefficiencies in NEFA uptake into the adipose
tissue following postprandial TAG lipolysis via lipoprotein lipase may result in
NEFA spillover into the blood and a subsequent increase in circulating NEFA
[@Almandoz2013a], which may be more metabolically active given postprandial 
activity. Second, the null findings may be due to the high risk population
examined in PROMISE. It may be that in this population, IR has become well
established and NEFA may not contribute to IR at this somewhat more advanced
stage in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Few studies have examined the composition of NEFA on metabolic functioning. One
recent, well-analyzed study used a variety of advanced fatty acid measurement
and statistical techniques to explore the multivariate relationship between the
NEFA composition and components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) [@Dai2015a].
Specifically, the authors identified NEFA
16:1n-9, 20:1n-9, and 22:4n-6 to correlate with components of the MetS. 
Another similar study examining diabetes found that 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3
may be useful biomarkers for identifying healthy compared to diabetic
individuals [@Liu2010a]. However, both studies were limited by
smaller sample sizes (approximately 100 subjects) and the cross-sectional
design.

There are a few important limitations to our study. NEFA were only quantified at
the baseline visit and as such we cannot investigate whether there were 
concomitant changes in NEFA and the metabolic measures. However, we believe this
is a strength for our specific objective, as the chance of reverse causality is 
reduced given that fatty acid and glucose metabolism pathways are tightly 
integrated. This is also an observational cohort, and there may be some residual
confounding we haven't considered or that couldn't be measured. Nonetheless,
potential covariates were empirically analyzed prior to inclusion into the
GEE models to best understand and minimizing potential
confounding. Finally, our cohort consists of individuals at-risk for diabetes, 
who are primarily female of European-ancestry and as such our results may not be
generalizable to other populations. However, given these limitations, our study
also has several strengths, including the longitudinal design and the rigorous
statistical techniques and methods applied, which are specifically suited to
investigating temporal relationships and to handling the multivariate nature of
the data. Lastly, our cohort contains highly detailed and comprehensive
variable measurements at each collection visit, and has both concentration and
mol% data for the fatty acids.

<!--
A limitation of these methods, excluding LCMM,
is that they can not be adjusted for covariates.

In conclusion, we found that total NEFA was a strong predictor for lower
beta-cell function over 6 years, irrespective of the specific composition of the
NEFA fraction. While future studies are needed to confirm these findings, our
results reinforce the importance of continuing to investigate the role of
circulating NEFA concentration on the natural history of diabetes.

Given the number of possible combinations of outcome and predictor variables,
only ISI and ISSI-2 with total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) were used to
compare various GEE models and to select a final model.  Baseline age was used
as including both the original age and the time variable would result in
collinearity.  Column names: QIC is the quasi-likelihood information criteria
(smaller values, eg. larger negative values, indicate a better fit compared to
other models), Delta is the QIC minus the lowest QIC (models with delta <10 are 
considered equivalent).  Models were:

- M0: log(ISSI-2) or log(ISI) = total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) + time
- M1: M0 + waist + sex + ethnicity + baseline age
- M2: M1 + ALT
- M3: M2 + physical activity
- M4: M3 + alcohol intake
- M5: M4 + family history of diabetes
- M6: M5 + smoking status
- M6.1: M6 + time by NEFA interaction
- M7: M2 + family history of diabetes + smoking status
- M8: M2 + family history of diabetes
- M8.1: M8 + time by NEFA interaction
