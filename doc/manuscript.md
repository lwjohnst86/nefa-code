# Background

Total non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) have been well documented to influence 
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Experimental work has shown that 
exposure to high concentrations of NEFA can induce insulin resistance in
insulin-sensitive tissue such as the muscle or liver and impair beta-cell
production of insulin [@Rachek2014a;@Cnop2008a]. Epidemiological and clinical
studies have observed similar findings, showing that elevated total plasma NEFA
associates with risk for diabetes [@Daniele2014a;@Salgin2012a].

Much of the previous experimental work frequently use fatty acids such as
palmitic acid (16:0) or oleic acid (18:1n-9), or use a standard oil such as soybean
oil as the exposure and generalize as total NEFA. However, fatty acids comprise
multiple classes of molecules with diverse physiological functions, with few
studies comparing different fatty acids. For instance, one study suggests that
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) can protect against the lipotoxic effect of
palmitic acid in the beta-cells [@Xiao2006].

Despite a sizable literature studying the role of NEFA in diabetes, there are 
important gaps in the research. In particular, there have been few long term 
studies in humans that have examined a range of NEFA species. Most studies have 
been on animals and cells, have been short term human infusion trials, or have 
been epidemiological studies that only looked at total NEFA. To date, there have
been no longitudinal studies examining the role of the composition of the NEFA 
blood lipid fraction on the pathogenesis of diabetes, which is key to 
understanding causal associations given the chronic nature of diabetes 
pathophysiology. Therefore, our research objective was to examine the role of
the serum NEFA composition on insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in a
longitudinal cohort. Some specific hypotheses included that higher palmitic acid
while lower polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid would 
associate with lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function.

# Subjects and Methods

Participants from London and Toronto, Canada, were recruited into the 
Prospective Metabolism and Islet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort. Eligibility 
for recruitment into PROMISE included having one or more risk factors for type 2
diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, hypertension, family history of diabetes, 
and/or a history of gestational diabetes or birth of a macrosomic infant. 
Participants aged 30 years and older (n=736) attended the baseline visit
between 2004-2006. Follow-up examinations occur every three years, with three
examination visits completed to date (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2013).  The
current study used data on participants who did not have diabetes at baseline,
who returned for one or more follow-up examinations, and who had samples
available for fatty acid measurements (n=477). A diagram of the sample size at
each visit is shown in Supplemental Figure S  1. At each examination,
participants undergo metabolic characterization, anthropometric measurements,
and questionnaires on lifestyle and sociodemographics. Research ethics approval
was obtained from Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario. 
Data collection methods were standardized across the 2 centres and research
nurses were centrally trained. 

## Blood measure assessments

At each examination, an 8-12 hour fasting blood sample was draw from each
participant, followed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 30
minute and 2 hour blood draw. All blood samples were processed and frozen at
-70°C. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured using standard laboratory
procedures. Cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides (TG) were measured using Roche
Modular's enzymatic colometric tests (Mississauga, ON).  Both specific insulin
and glucose were derived from the OGTT at fasting, 30 minute, and 2 hour time
points. Specific insulin was measured using the Elecsys 1010 (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay. This assay shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to intact human pro-insulin
and the Des 31,32 circulating split form (Linco Res. Inc), and has a CV of 9.3%.
Glucose was determined using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular, Roche
Diagnostics) with a detection range of 0.11 (2 mg/dL) to 41.6 mmol/L.  The
inter-assay %CV is <1.1% and intra-assay %CV is < 1.9%.  All assays were
performed at the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre Core Lab at the University of
Toronto. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and
diabetes were categorized using the 2006 WHO criteria [@WHO2006].

NEFA composition was quantified using stored fasting serum samples from the 
baseline visit, which had been frozen at -70°C for 4-6 years and had not been 
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles. Serum fatty acids have been documented to be
stable at these temperatures for up to 10 years [@Matthan2010a]. A known amount 
of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) {{confirm}} was added to the serum as an internal 
standard prior to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch 
[@Folch1957a]. Each serum lipid fraction (NEFA, cholesteryl ester, phospholipid,
and triacylglycerol) was isolated using thin layer chromatography, which were
visualized under UV light after lightly spraying with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene
sulfonic acid (0.1% wt/vol) and then converted to fatty acid methyl esters with
14% boron trifluoride in methanol at 100°C for 1 h. Fatty acid methyl esters
were separated and quantified using a Varian-430 gas chromatograph (Varian, Lake
Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a Varian Factor Four capillary column and a flame
ionization detector, which were injected in splitless mode. Fatty acid
concentrations (nmol/ml) were calculated by proportional comparison of gas
chromatography peak areas to that of the internal standards [@Nishi2014a;
@Chen2011a].  There were 22 fatty acids measured in the NEFA fraction. Given the
diverse biology, as well as the complexity of the analyses, the other lipid
fractions were split into separate reports (see {{pl and ce paper}} for the
analysis of the phospholipid and cholesteryl ester fractions).

## Outcome variables

Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function indices were computed using the OGTT 
glucose and insulin. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using 1/HOMA-IR (1
divided by HOMA-IR) [@Matthews1985] and the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI)
[@Matsuda1999]. HOMA-IR largely reflects hepatic insulin resistance, while ISI
reflects whole-body insulin sensitivity [@AbdulGhani2007].  Beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic Index [@Wareham1995] over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR)
and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) [@Retnakaran2009]. IGI/IR
is a measure of the first phase insulin secretion while ISSI-2 is analogous to
the disposition index. Each index has been validated against gold standard
measures [@Matthews1985; @Matsuda1999; @Retnakaran2009].

## Anthropometrics and sociodemographics

Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at all clinic 
examinations using standard procedures.  WC was measured at the natural waist, 
defined as the narrowest part of the torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid
process. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m) squared.
Sociodemographic information, such as age, sex, and ethnicity, were determined
using questionnaires administered at each examination. In the lifestyle
questionnaire, physical activity was determined using a version of the
Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) [@Kriska1990].  The MAQ collects 
information on leisure and occupational activity, including intensity, 
frequency, and duration, over the past year.  Each reported activity from the 
MAQ was weighted by its metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of 
MET-hours per week.

## Statistical analysis

The primary outcome variables for the PROMISE cohort and this analyses were 
1/HOMA-IR, ISI, IGI/IR, and ISSI-2; outcome variables were log-transformed for
the statistical modeling. The primary predictor variables for this study were
the 22 NEFA as a mole percent (mol%) of the total fraction and as a 
concentration (nmol/mL). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the
individual NEFA and with other continuous variables.

For the primary analysis, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models 
[@Zeger1986a] were used to determine the longitudinal associations between the 
outcome variables and the predictor variables. Given the longitudinal design 
an auto-regressive (AR1) correlation matrix was chosen for the GEE models, 
though other matrices (eg. exchangeable) had similar fit (data not shown). GEE
is well suited to cohort studies given it's capacity to handle missed visits.
The predictor variables and continuous covariates were scaled (mean centered and
standardized). The NEFA variables were classified as *time-independent* (held
constant) as they were measured only at the baseline visit, while the outcome
variables and covariates were set as *time-dependent*. No imputation was
conducted on missing values.

Covariate selection was based on previous literature, directed acyclic graph 
[@Greenland1999a] recommendations, and quasi-likelihood information criterion 
(QIC). Supplemental Table S  1 shows the covariates compared using QIC and 
Supplemental Figure S  9 shows the specified directed acyclic graph. The final GEE model 
we selected differed between insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function models. 
For insulin sensitivity, we adjusted for time, sex, ethnicity, baseline age, WC,
ALT, MET, alcohol intake, and family history of diabetes (M6). For beta-cell
function, the last few models were comparable in performance, so we chose the
simplest model (M8), adjusting for time, sex, ethnicity, baseline age, WC, ALT,
and family history of diabetes. After scaling, log-transforming, and
exponentiating the GEE estimates, the GEE results are interpreted as an expected
percent difference in the outcome variable for every SD increase in the
predictor variable given the covariates are held constant. While models with a
time interaction did not perform better than others for the QIC (M6.1 and M8.1)
in Supplemental Table S  1, we ran models with a time by predictor term for each of
the NEFA to test if there was an interaction by time. Given that TG is a risk factor
for diabetes and that NEFA contribute to TG production, TG may act as a mediator
between NEFA and the outcomes. However, only a subset of the participants at the
6-yr visit had clinically measured TG. To determine the role of TG in the
association between NEFA and the outcomes, TG was included in the GEE model as a
sensitivity analysis. Lastly for the GEE models, we tested for an interaction
with sex or ethnicity by the predictor term for the outcome variables.

While GEE controls for the longitudinal design of the data, a limitation is that
it can not analyze the inherent multivariate nature of the composition of the 
NEFA fraction. As such, after running the GEE models for the longitudinal 
analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to
identify the patterns of NEFA composition against beta-cell function (using ISSI-2,
which has most of the associations in the GEE models) and for those who converted or
maintained dysglycemia status (either IFG, IGT, or DM) over the 6 years. Since
PLS-DA can't handle longitudinal data, the longitudinal data was included by
extracting latent trajectories of beta-cell function (ISSI-2) over the 6 years using
latent class mixed models (LCMM). A limitation of these methods, excluding LCMM,
is that they can not be adjusted for covariates.

All analyses were performed using R 3.2.4 [@Rbase], along with the R
packages geepack 1.2.0.1 for GEE [@Hoejsgaard2006a], caret
6.0.64 for PLS-DA, and lcmm 1.7.5 for
LCMM. The R code for this manuscript is available at {{link}}. Results were
statistically significance at p<0.05, after adjusting for multiple testing using
the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [@Benjamini1995a].

## Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort

Within this subset of the PROMISE cohort at the baseline visit, 
349 (73%) were females and 337 (70.5%) had European-ancestry.
The average age of the participants was 50.2 years 
(9.8 SD) and the average BMI was
31.1 (6.4 SD). Most of the 
subset of the cohort, 308 (64.8%), had a family history of diabetes.
The primary outcome variables had a significant median decline between 
14.4% to 26.4% (p<0.001) over the 6
years in this subset of the PROMISE cohort.
Consistent with this decline, there were 42 (9%) <!--40 (8%)-->
participants who developed diabetes while 96 (20%) participants either
converted to or maintained IFG or IGT status over the 6 years.

Figure  1 shows the distribution of the NEFA composition. Four 
individual NEFA made up the vast majority (89.3%) of the total
NEFA fraction. The largest contributors were 18:1n-9 (36.6%), 
16:0 (23.5%), 18:0 (15.2%), and 18:2n-6 (14%). All
individual NEFA as well as the total fraction had weak to no correlations
(r<0.3) with the basic characteristics (see Supplemental Figure S  2).

## GEE modeling

Several associations were seen in the unadjusted GEE models 
(see Supplemental Figure S  3), particularly for the concentration data. Full model 
adjustment (Figure  2) attenuated most of these associations, where
total NEFA, 16:0, and 18:2n-6 (all as nmol/mL) had negative associations between
IGI/IR and ISSI-2. The magnitude of association for each of these variables was
fairly consistent for each beta-cell function measure. For every one SD decrease
in any of these three NEFA variables, there was an average predicted
8.4% lower IGI/IR and 4.1% lower ISSI-2 at each
clinic visit. None of the NEFA variables as a mol% had any association with the
outcomes. Adjusting for TG attenuates all associations with IGI/IR and ISSI-2
(data not shown), though sample size at the 6 year visit is restricted to n=128
in those who had TG measured. There were no significant interaction effects
between time, sex, or ethnicity and the individual NEFA on any of the outcome
measures (data not shown). Raw values from the GEE models are shown in 
Supplemental Table S  3 for unadjusted models and Supplemental Table S  2 for fully
adjusted models.

## Latent trajectory and NEFA pattern recognition

Three latent classes were extracted from LCMM, with 270 
participants in the high, 119 in the middle, and 
84
in the low beta-cell function groups. The trajectories of the three groups are
shown in Supplemental Figure S  4. These groups were used as the beta-cell function
response variables in the PLS-DA analysis. The PLS-DA results show a very poor
discriminatory ability of the NEFA composition in classifying participants into
the correct beta-cell function latent class. Only 
272 (57.5%) 
participants were correctly classified, primarily into the
middle group. The specific NEFA composition was not able to accurately classify
participants who had low or high beta-cell function.
Supplemental Figure S  5 shows the loadings of individual NEFA by the
extracted component and Supplemental Figure S  6 shows the clustering of
the components by ISSI-2 latent class. The PLS-DA analysis using dysglycemia
status conversion or maintanence as the response variable showed similar poor 
discriminatory ability, though better than the beta-cell function trajectory
results. While 347 (72.6%) participants were
classified correctly based on dysglycemia status, examining the clustering of
the NEFA composition showed poor discrimination between groups (see
Supplemental Figure S  7 and Supplemental Figure S  8).

# Discussion

In a Canadian population of adults who are at-risk for diabetes, we found that
higher total NEFA independently predicted a lower beta-cell function over 6 years.
While we found negative association with palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1n-9), and
linoleic acid (18:2n-6) as a concentration (nmol/mL), no associations were seen
for the proportion of these fatty acids and further clustering analysis found no
predictive ability of these NEFA on beta-cell function or dysglycemia. These
observations suggest that the absolute size of the total fraction, rather than
the specific composition of any individual NEFA, likely influences the
pathogenesis of diabetes.

The role of total NEFA on diabetes is a well-studied area of research. 
Epidemiological studies have shown that higher NEFA associate with lower insulin
secretion and a higher risk for developing diabetes 
[@Salgin2012a;@Pankow2004a]. In a cross-sectional analysis of the RISCK cohort,
total NEFA had a negative association with insulin sensitivity and a
particularly strong negative association with beta-cell function [@Johns2014a].
Experimentally, several potential mechanisms have been elucidated for the role
of NEFA on beta-cell function, particularly for palmitic acid. Prolonged
exposure to elevated NEFA can induce apoptosis in the beta-cells, possibly
through endoplasmic reticulum stress, formation of ceramides, and generation of
nitric oxide, as well as impairment of proinsulin production and mitochrondial
function [@Cnop2008a; @Maris2013a; @Carpentier2003a; @Giacca2011a; @Xiao2009a].
The present analysis is the first study to our knowledge to examine a broad
spectrum of individual NEFA in a cohort setting on beta-cell function. We found
that there was a strong signal of higher total NEFA, palmitic acid, oleic acid,
and linoleic acid as concentrations with lower beta-cell function. However, as
both a mol% and using clustering analyses, no individual or specific
composition of the NEFA fraction predicted lower beta-cell function, insulin
sensitivity, or dysglycemia status. Together, these results suggest that the
absolute size of the NEFA fraction, irrespective of any specific composition of
fatty acid species, exerts it's hypothesized lipotoxic effects on the
beta-cells.

Biologically, within a free-living population chronic elevation of NEFA may be 
mediating it's association through TG. In normal metabolism, NEFA enters the 
liver and assists in the production of TG that is to be processed into very-low
density lipoproteins (VLDL) [@Nielsen2012a]. As such higher NEFA may contribute 
to hypertriglyceridemia, which is a known risk factor for diabetes. In the
sensitivity analysis adjusting for TG, all associations with beta-cell function
were attenuated, suggesting that NEFA may in fact be mediating it's association
through TG. However, a major limitation to the TG-adjusted GEE models is the
reduced sample size in the 6 year visit, as only a subset (n=128) of
participants had TG measured.

There is substantial experimental evidence highlighting the role of increased 
NEFA and a subsequent increase in insulin resistance via impairment of insulin 
signaling cascades (reviewed in multiple articles 
[@Martins2012a;@Ebbert2013a;@Capurso2012a;@Surampudi2009]). However, in this
longitudinal analysis, we saw no association between any individual or total
NEFA and neither hepatic (1/HOMA-IR) nor whole-body insulin sensitivity (ISI). 
There are some possible explanations for our findings. Previous studies done *in
vivo* were mostly short term infusion 
[@Xiao2009a;@Xiao2006;@Szendroedi2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a] or pharmocologic
[@Daniele2014a;@Liang2013a] trials and the observational research was generally
cross-sectional or correlational
[@Miller2012a;@Johns2014a;@Bush2012a;@Ilyasova2010a]. The limitation of these
studies were the short time periods examined or the experimentally-induced
elevations in NEFA concentrations, making it difficult to assess the causal role
in non-experimental environments over long time frames. Moreover, some studies
have found null or weak associations of NEFA and IR 
[@Gray2013a;@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a;@Johns2014a], suggesting that either
NEFA has only a minor role in IR or that NEFA is the effect, but not cause, of
the underlying IR. Adipose tissue, which release NEFA during fasting, can become
insulin resistant and thus lipolysis of intracellular TG by hormone-sensitive 
lipase may not respond to the inhibitory action of insulin. As such, IR may 
develop before elevations in blood NEFA. There is also evidence to suggest that 
insulin may be involved in NEFA uptake [@Ramos-Roman2012a], further supporting 
the hypothesis that elevated NEFA is a consequence of higher IR. However, we 
could not examine this potential hypothesis as NEFA was only collected at the
baseline visit.

There are two other possible explanations for our null findings for the insulin
sensitivity measures. First, there may be differences in physiology between
fasting and postprandial NEFA kinetics. For instance, some experimental studies
using the clamp found that fasting NEFA was a weak predictor of insulin
sensitivity compared to postprandial concentrations of NEFA
[@Magkos2012a;@Kehlenbrink2012a]. Inefficiencies in NEFA uptake into the adipose
tissue following postprandial TG lipolysis via lipoprotein lipase may result in
NEFA spillover into the blood and a subsequent increase in circulating NEFA
[@Almandoz2013a], which may be more metabolically active given postprandial 
activity. Second, the null findings may be due to the high risk population
examined in PROMISE. It may be that in this population, IR has become well
established and NEFA may not contribute to IR at this stage in the pathogenesis
of diabetes.

Few studies have examined the composition of NEFA on metabolic functioning. One
recent, well analyzed study used a variety of advanced fatty acid measurement
and statistical techniques to explore the multivariate relationship between the
NEFA composition and components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) [@Dai2015a].
Specifically, using the statistical techniques the authors identified NEFA
16:1n-9, 20:1n-9, and 22:4n-6 to most correlate with components of the MetS. 
Another similar study examining diabetes found that 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3
may be useful biomarkers for identifying healthy compared to diabetic
individuals [@Liu2010a]. However, in both studies, major limitations were the
smaller sample sizes (approximately 100 subjects) and the cross-sectional
design.

There are a few important limitations to our study. NEFA were only quantified at
the baseline visit and as such we can not investigate whether there were 
concomitant changes in NEFA and the metabolic measures. However, we believe this
is a strength for our specific objective, as the chance of reverse causality is 
reduced given that fatty acid and glucose metabolism pathways are tightly 
integrated. This is also an observational cohort, and there may be some residual
confounding we haven't considered or that couldn't be measured. Nonetheless, we 
were as thorough as possible in understanding and minimizing potential 
confounding. Finally, our cohort consists of individuals at-risk for diabetes, 
who are primarily female of European-ancestry and as such our results may not be
generalizable to other populations. However, given these limitations, our study
also has several strengths, including the longitudinal design and the rigorous
statistical techniques and methods applied, which are specifically suited to
investigating temporal relationships and to handling the multivariate nature of
the data. Lastly, our cohort contains highly detailed and comprehensive
variable measurements at each collection visit, and has both concentration and
mol% data for the fatty acids.

In conclusion, we found that total NEFA was a strong predictor for lower
beta-cell function over 6 years, irrespective of the specific composition of the
NEFA fraction. While future studies are needed to confirm these findings, given
the cost and labour involved in quantifying the NEFA composition, our results
suggest that further research on the NEFA composition may not be as fruitful and
cost-effective then if the simpler, easy to measure total NEFA concentration was
used.

Table: Supplemental Table S  1: Comparing generalized estimating equation models adjusting for different covariates using Quasi-Likelihood Information Criterion.

Given the number of possible combinations of outcome and predictor variables,
only ISI and ISSI-2 with total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) were used to
compare various GEE models and to select a final model.  Baseline age was used
as including both the original age and the time variable would result in
collinearity.  Column names: QIC is the quasi-likelihood information criteria
(smaller values, eg. larger negative values, indicate a better fit compared to
other models), Delta is the QIC minus the lowest QIC (models with delta <10 are 
considered equivalent).  Models were:

- M0: log(ISSI-2) or log(ISI) = total non-esterified fatty acids (nmol/mL) + time
- M1: M0 + waist + sex + ethnicity + baseline age
- M2: M1 + ALT
- M3: M2 + physical activity
- M4: M3 + alcohol intake
- M5: M4 + family history of diabetes
- M6: M5 + smoking status
- M6.1: M6 + time by NEFA interaction
- M7: M2 + family history of diabetes + smoking status
- M8: M2 + family history of diabetes
- M8.1: M8 + time by NEFA interaction

Table: Supplemental Table S  3: Unadjusted generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal associations of individual non-esterified fatty acids (mol% and nmol/mL) with insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function over the 6 years in the PROMISE cohort.  Adjusted for time only. Outcome variables were log-transformed, predictor variables were scaled, and x-axis values were exponentiated to represent percent difference per SD increase in the fatty acid.  P-values were adjusted for the BH false discovery rate, indicated by asterisk.
